The files in the Cdist directory were download from
<http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_c/novasc3.1.tar.gz>.
The file ./Cdist/CIO_RA.TXT was subsequently compressed.  If you use
it per the installation instructions on the website, you will need to
decompress it.

The sample JPL ephemeris file was obtained from
<ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/Linux/de421/>.

The NOVAS source code is built such that the external library symbols
are prefixed with novas_.  Also, typedefs names have been changed such
that foo becomes Novas_foo_t.
